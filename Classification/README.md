# Classification Mini Projects

Welcome to the "Classification" folder! This folder contains a collection of mini projects that focus on various classification tasks using different machine learning algorithms.

## What is Classification?

Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the goal is to predict the category or class of a target variable based on input features. It is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning and finds applications in a wide range of domains, including image recognition, spam detection, and medical diagnosis.

## Mini Projects

### 1: Spam Email Classification

In this project, you'll build a classification model to differentiate between spam and non-spam (ham) emails using text data and natural language processing techniques.
